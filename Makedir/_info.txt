_info.txt

This folder 'Makedir/' and all files and folders within need to
be world writable.

The toolchain 'RenderDocumentation' requires this 'makedir' folder.

The toolchain reads the settings of './buildsettings.sh'
and expects './conf.py' to exist.

The toolchain creates file './build.checksum' and others
named './temp_*'.

The Docker-build-process will fetch provide the most recent
'conf.py'.

The toolchain 'RenderDocumentation' is more and more being
modified to accept all needed parameters from the commandline.
Therefore in future the 'makedir' folder may not be necessary
any more.

End.

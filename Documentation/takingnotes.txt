Building (for developers)
=========================

Run build:

    docker build -t t3docs/render-documentation .

In case you have an `apt-cacher <https://docs.docker.com/engine/examples/apt-cacher-ng/>`__
at hand this may be *the* way. Apt-packages are then downloaded only once and kept
to later be reused again::

    docker start my-apt-cacher
    HOSTIP=$(ip route get 8.8.8.8 | awk '{print $NF; exit}')
    docker build -t t3docs/t3docs/render-documentation --build-arg http_proxy=http://${HOSTIP}:3142 .
